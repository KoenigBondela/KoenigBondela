👋 Welcome to my GitHub!

⏳ I'm learning to program for now, but I have a great future!

💻 I'm an aspiring computer security and development specialist.

🌍 I study Computer Security at the best university in the Sverdlovsk Region and top 10 of the Russian Federation - UrSU.

📕 The story of my love for programming starts at a small age. When I was still in primary school, I inadvertently learnt Assembler and after that I started to study the programming sphere more deeply.

☁️ I hope to find a team to create joint projects soon...
